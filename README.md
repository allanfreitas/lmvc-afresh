# LMVC Afresh (A fresh start)

Start a fresh LMVC project by cloning this repository. It offers a basic configuration with its folder structures.

It depends on *composer* and *bower* for fetching its basic set of dependencies. Feel free to add dependencies to the `composer.json` and/or `bower.json`.

Just run `sh bootstrap.sh` to run *composer*, *bower* and set *chmods* on all caching directories appropriately. Calling the bootstrap script as in `sh boostrap.sh no-chmod` will omitt setting *chmods* on cache directories.

You could even call `bash -c "$(curl -fsSL http://raw.github.com/scandio/lmvc-afresh/master/scripts/install.sh)"` which does all the cloning and config-file setup for you!
